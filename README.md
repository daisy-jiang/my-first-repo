**My favorite hobby is drawing**
My **sister** inspired me to draw
I usually spend at least half an hour drawing everyday
I enjoy that **I am able to create what I have in my mind and visualize it even more once it's on paper**
I learned a few things about **anatomy and shading**
One time I was drawing outside and when I closed my sketch book to go to another place since the **place I was in before had a bunch of bugs** I accidently **squashed** one in between the pages of the book and it was yellow and a wing stuck out.
